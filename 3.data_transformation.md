# Data Transformation

Being able to slice, re-organise, create new variables and manipulate your data is essential to doing any data science problem with real data. Building the tools to be able to do this is an on-going process, not only are there many tools to learn, but the tools are often growing as people continue to create new packages. 

We're going to continue working through the R for Data Science book to explore the different data transformation tools within the tidyverse, start at [Chapter 5](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html) and work your way through the chapter and the exercises. 

Grab our attention if you get stuck. Don't waste your time suffering in silence.
