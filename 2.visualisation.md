# Visualisation using ggplot2

Visualisation with ggplot2 is a great place to start learning to use R. There are many datasets already built into R that you can use to develop for vis skills without getting stuck on data cleaning and data wrangling. The nice thing about vis as a beginner is that you can see the effects of the code you are learning.      

Before we get started, a few points:   
1. ggplot2 is what we call apackage. Essentially a package is a bundle of code, functions and tools wrapped up together in one place. There are hundreds of thousands of packages created by the open source community. R doesn't come with all packages installed, you need to tell it what you want to use.  
2. ggplot2 is not the only way to create visualisation and graphics in R. But it's the most popular. 
2. ggplot2 stands for the `Grammer of Graphics` and was created, and is maintained by Hadley Whickham.
3. There are loads of online resources about using ggplot, this page has lots of examples of different ggplot graphs and example code to create them here are some examples [http://ggplot2.org/](http://ggplot2.org/).


## Get started
We're going to use Hadley Whickham's book `R for Data Science` to start the journey into data visualisation.

[Start here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) at Chapter 3 and work through the Visualisation chapter and exercises __Up to the end of 3.5__.    

We've skiped the intro to the book, but feel free to go back and read  it, it will only be helpful.
