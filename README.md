# Introduction
Welcome to this Intro to R course. There are many R resources available on the we, this repo aims to guide you to some of those reseources that are uesful for beginners rather than re-creating a beginner course form scratch. 

## Workshop Style
The workshop style will be a little different to workshops you have been to in the past. There will be less listening to a presenter and more doing and asking questions. There will be people of different levels in the workshop and in order to cater for everyone, you will need to take initiative for your own progress. Experienced R users will be in the room to help you along the way.       

You will not leave a one day workshop as fully acomplished R programmer, just as you would not leave your first weight training sessions as a body builder. The aim of this workshops is to start you along the journey so that you can continue developing on your own. 

We will predominantly working throgh Hadley Wickham'd [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book as the main learning framework.
