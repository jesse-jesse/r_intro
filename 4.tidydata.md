## Tidy Data
Here's a simple and clear description of tidydata from [wikapeadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data), and some [further reading](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html) from Hadley Wickham if you're interested. Plus, [Hadley Wickham's 2014 JSS Paper](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v059i10)

## What is Tidy Data?
Basically, tidy data is:
    - 1 observation = 1 row
    - 1 variable = 1 column
    
## Tidyverse

The tidyverse is a bundle of packages that help with creating, cleaning, manipulating data to a tidy format and then work with that data easily to answer your data science questions. 

The tools in the tidyverse are geared toward:
    1. Turning data into Tidy Data
    2. Plotting/Modelling/Analysing Tidy Data

Here is some information about the packages within the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). It isn't important that you understand all the packages right now.   

You will have installed the tidyverse into your R studio session already if you copmleted the visualisation chapter in the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book, see item 2 on the checklist.


## Is This Tidy Data?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars))
```

## Is This Tidy Data?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tribble(
    ~FY, ~Week, ~Mon, ~Tue, ~Wed, ~Thur, ~Fri, ~Sat, ~Sun,
    1617,    1,   40,   45,   58,    74,   92,   80,  116,
    1617,    2,   38,   42,   63,    76,   88,   90,  120,
    1617,    3,   32,   43,   59,    68,   102,  78,   91
))
```

## Tidied! (almost)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(tribble(
    ~FY, ~Week, ~Mon, ~Tue, ~Wed, ~Thur, ~Fri, ~Sat, ~Sun,
    1617,    1,   40,   45,   58,    74,   92,   80,  116,
    1617,    2,   38,   42,   63,    76,   88,   90,  120,
    1617,    3,   32,   43,   59,    68,   102,  78,   91
) %>% gather(key = "Day", value = "Sales", Mon:Sun)
)
    
```

## Is This Tidy Data?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
 knitr::kable(as.data.frame(Titanic) %>% 
              arrange(Class) %>%
              head())

```

## Tidied!
```{r, echo=FALSE}
 knitr::kable(as.data.frame(Titanic) %>% 
              arrange(Class) %>%
              spread(key = Survived, value = Freq) %>%      
              head())
```

## Tidying Data
* The package for tidying data is `tidyr`. With it you can:
    - `gather()` columns up into rows (stack, melt, unpivot)
    - `spread()` rows out over columns (unstack, cast, pivot)
    - `seprate()` one column into many
    - `unite()` many columns into one
    - `fill()` and `drop_na()` values
    - And more!


## Exercise
We're going to tidy the data in `PRAC_HOME/data/tb_who.csv`.

starter code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
tb_cases <- read_csv(file.path(COURSE_HOME,"data/tb_who.csv"))
View(tb_cases)
```

* What are the issues with this data?
* What `tidyr` methods can be used to fix it?
