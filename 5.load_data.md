## Loading Data

Using data that is already available in R is a good place to start learning, but at some point you will want to start looking at your own data. Today we will only explore how to import `csv` and `xlsx` file formats, as well as a nifty package called `datapasta`. If you would like to explore different formats [Chapter 11](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) in the `R for Data Science` book is a great place to start.   

If there is a specific alternate data format that you work with and would like to learn how to import, let one of the tutors know. The following material is predominanty from `R for Data Science` [Chapter 11](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html). 

### Let's Get Started

1. Load the `tidyverse`, `xlsx`, `readxl` and `datapasta` packages.

```
#install.library("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
install.packages("datapasta")
library(datapasta)
```

#### CSV Files
`read_csv()` from the `readr` packages reads comma delimited files. The first argument to read_csv() is the most important: itâ€™s the path to the file to read.

```
data_name <- read_csv("YOUR_DATA_FILE_NAME_HERE")
```
if you haven't set the working directory up for your project you will need to tell the `read_csv()` function the full file name. Something like this.

```
data_name <- read_csv("/User/robertj9/R_intro/YOUR_DATA_FILE_NAME_HERE")
```

#### Excel Files 

`read_excel()`, `read_xls` or `read_xlsx()` from the `readxl` package reads excel files. This is particularly handy if your data isn't in the first sheet of an excel workbook. The most important arguments within the `read_excel()` function are: path, sheet and col_names. `sheet = ` should be the sheet number you want to read from. `col_names = ` TRUE or FALSE, TRUE will preserve the first row of the file as column names, false will not. 

```
data_name <- read_excel(path, sheet = NULL, col_names = TRUE)
```

#### Datapasta
