## Loading Data

Using data that is already available in R is a good place to start learning, but at some point, you will want to start looking at your own data. There are lots of different data types and packages for loading data, today we will only explore the importing `csv` and `xlsx`, as well as a nifty package called `datapasta`.

If there is a specific alternate data format that you work with and would like to learn how to import, let one of the tutors know. The following material is taken directly from `R for Data Science` [Chapter 11](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html. 

### Let's Get Started

1. Load the `tidyverse` and the `xlsx` packages.

```
#install.library("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)
install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)
```

#### CSV Files
`read_csv()` from the `readr` packages reads comma delimited files. The first argument to read_csv() is the most important: itâ€™s the path to the file to read.

```
data_name <- read_csv("YOUR_DATA_FILE_NAME_HERE")
```
if you haven't set the working directory up for your project you will need to tell the `read_csv()` function the full file name. Something like this. 

```
data_name <- read_csv("/User/robertj9/R_intro/YOUR_DATA_FILE_NAME_HERE")
```

#### Excel Files 

`read_excel()`, `read_xls` or `read_xlsx()` fromt he `readxl` package reads excel files. This is particularly handy if you wish to read data from sheets within an excel file. The most usefull arguments within the `read_excel()` function are: path, sheet and col_names.

```
read_excel(path, sheet = NULL, col_names = TRUE)
```
